# The code for drawing a horizontal line
# - $a0: the x coordinate of the starting point for this line.
# - $a1: the y coordinate of the starting point for this line.
# - $a2: the length of this line, measured in pixels
# - $a3: the height of this line, measured in pixels
# - $t0: the address of the first pixel (top left) in the bitmap
# - $t1: the horizontal offset of the first pixel in the line.
# - $t2: the vertical offset of the first pixel in the line.
# - #t3: the location in bitmap memory of the current pixel to draw 
# - $t4: the colour value to draw on the bitmap
# - $t5: the bitmap location for the end of the horizontal line.
